Vulnerability taken care
1) We are hashing the password  before storing it in the database. This prevents from potential misuse of password of DB administrator.
2) By utilizing a Database with the "select by update" feature, we can effectively manage race conditions. With Postgres DB being our chosen database, we have the assurance that our code will not be susceptible to hazardous race conditions.

Potential Vulnerability
1) Having postgres db host and password in Docker compose file
    Nonetheless, we have taken steps to reduce the potential harm by operating a docker container, which prevents the user from obtaining elevated access to the server system. While we have implemented reasonably robust passwords, there remains a possibility that these passwords could be compromised, thereby enabling unauthorized access to the server.
    
2) We are assuming that Amazon server gives the right data (i.e. right package id, warehouse id etc) If there is any error. We would just mark the order and package as error. We are not however
    re triggering the job and relaying amzon this information.
